<p> A cool school project :D </p>
<p> Use only your mouse and the right click.</p>
<p> But also maybe you can slide your mouse to the right and the left</p>
<h2> If you don't want all the files on your pc, here is the direct link  <a href= "https://elyseadriaens.github.io/shad_e_volv_ibes/shadevolve.html"> shadevolve </a></h2>
<p> I program anything, but i use the free trials of saola animate to make this one </p>
<p> I hope that you will appreciate </p>
